                Taguig National High School is considered one of the premier and oldest high schools in Taguig, home of Global City. Taguig City is situated at the northwestern shore of Laguna de Bay, right at the upper north of the legendary Pasig River. It is bordered by the town of Pateros and Pasig to the East, the towns of Tagaytay and Laguna Lake to the South, and the towns of Muntinlupa, Paranaque, Makati, and Pasay to the West. With a total land area of 4,538.20 hectares or 45.3 square kilometers, Taguig consists of 8 barangays. Taguig National High School is located in Barangay Lower Bicutan, one of these barangays.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Formerly an agricultural town where most people were engaged in farming, Taguig has transformed into a thriving part of Metro Manila, showcasing a booming economy. This transformation is seen in the rise of industrial and commercial buildings in places like FTI Complex, Bagumbayan, and Bicutan, as well as the highly modernized Fort Bonifacio Global City. Every Taguigeno looks forward to the future with optimism. As people say, "ANG TAGUIG AY MAGIGING BUKAMBIBIG SA BUONG DAIGDIG." (Taguig will become the talk of the town.)

            <div class="section-title">The Establishment of the School</div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                On January 8, 1980, the Fort A. Bonifacio College Annex at the Tenement Building was converted into a public high school, which was proclaimed as Taguig National High School under a Memorandum of Agreement dated July 20, 1979, during the administration of Mayor Levi Mariano. Due to the fast-growing population, the existing classrooms, including the chapel, were insufficient. As a result, additional classrooms were built at the FTI Kadiwa Building.

            <p class="paragraph">
                In 1948, the school expanded its operations by opening an Annex in Ususan, Taguig. In the same year, Dr. Isabelita L. Montesa, the principal, along with PTA officials, worked to transfer the school to the former Institutions of Rehabilitation for Man (IRM) at Lower Bicutan. The new site, covering 3,300 square meters, had eighteen (18) buildings housing 79 classrooms, 2 laboratory rooms, 2 school canteens, an AVR, and 8 faculty rooms. The school grounds are landscaped with trees, vegetables, and ornamental plants, and a covered court accommodates students during their physical education activities.

            <p class="paragraph">
                During the school year 2001-2002, enrollment reached more than 6,000 students with 164 faculty members. However, with the establishment of new high schools in the division, enrollment numbers gradually dropped, and the current enrollment stands at 2,200 students.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Academically, the school has produced dedicated mentors and winning candidates in various subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, Araling Panlipunan, Journalism, and Technology and Livelihood Education. These achievements earned the school recognition as a center of culture and excellence from 1995 to 2002.
